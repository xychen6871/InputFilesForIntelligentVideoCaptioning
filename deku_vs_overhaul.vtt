00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Why won't anyone...

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.000
...look at the big picture?

00:00:07.5 --> 00:00:12.000
What I'm going to tear down
is this world--its very framework!

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.5
Your Justice is small.
You only see what's in front of you.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.500
It's mere sentimentalism.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.000
You hero pretenders...

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Stay out of my way!

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.000
If I can't save...

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
...the one small girl in front of me...

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
...how can I become...

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.000
...a hero who saves everyone?

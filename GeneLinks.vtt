WEBVTT - Mario Golf: Advance Tour, Gene, (Super POW Woods, Sweet Control Irons and Wedges), Links Random 9 Holes, Back Tee

00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.500
Today, we'll be playing 
Mario Golf: Advance Tour, 
and we'll be using Gene
for this round.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Gene used to be called
"The King of Birdies"
and was once the 
champion of the Links Club.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.000
He lost that title
when Kid defeated him in 
Singles tournament play.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.000
Right now, his stats seem
to be unremarkable.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
His drive isn't really that
great since Kid, Mario,
and DK can all hit farther
than him. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
His swing control and
impact leave a bit to
be desired.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
His only real strength 
is his above-average spin.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But let's see if
we can change that
with Custom Clubs.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We'll play on the Star Links
 Course. 9 random holes
from the back tee. 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.372
Holy shit! I did not expect
that to happen.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.250
We're off to a
 pretty good start!

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.260
Probably shouldn't have
used backspin TBH.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.360
Close, but no cigar. 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:20.320
Good thing the timing
was on point for the 
2nd stroke.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Ugh, this is going to be tricky.
Gene's shot trajectory makes it
difficult to land the ball
on the green in the 1st shot.

00:04:12.133 --> 00:04:15.240
Unsurprisingly, the ball didn't
land on the green.

00:04:20.024 --> 00:04:27.003
Thankfully, we were still able
to salvage a birdie.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Goddamnit.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.400
Third time's the charm.
Huh.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
That's the third time
Gene got a birdie with a
chip-in.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.432
Goddamn...
Gene's on a roll at this point.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.271
Four birdies in a row and a
goddamn eagle on his first hole.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.065
Too bad the birdie streak's
gonna end on this hole.

00:06:45.392 --> 00:06:47.262
Good thing the ball still 
landed on the fairway...

00:07:29.287 --> 00:07:31.288
This could be trouble...

00:07:40.288 --> 00:07:44.200
At this point, Gene's not
going to get an eagle
for this hole.

00:07:55.217 --> 00:07:58.195
But a birdie is still possible.

00:08:12.018 --> 00:08:20.800
Final Score: -8
A very good round for Gene.

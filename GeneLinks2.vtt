WEBVTT - Mario Golf: Advance Tour, Gene, (Super POW Woods, Sweet Control Irons and Wedges), Links Random 9 Holes, Back Tee

00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.250
Today, we'll be playing 
Mario Golf: Advance Tour

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.000 
For this round,
we'll be using Gene.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.600
Gene used to be called
"The King of Birdies"

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:13.370
...and was once the 
champion of the Links Club.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.000
Unfortunately for him,
he lost that title to Kid.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.690
Right now, his stats 
are unremarkable.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
His drive isn't really
that great (250 yds).

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.000
His swing control and
impact are a bit weak.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.000
His only real strength 
is his above-average spin.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.306
But Custom Clubs can help
improve his effectiveness.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We'll play on the
Star Links Course. 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.420
9 random holes
from the back tee. 

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:25.250
So far so good...

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.372
Holy shit! I did not expect
that to happen.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.250
We're off to a
 pretty good start!

00:01:57.316 --> 00:02:00.250
Better safe than sorry...

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.260
Probably shouldn't have
used backspin TBH.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.360
Close, but no cigar. 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:20.320
Good thing Gene's timing
was on point.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.337
Ugh, this is gonna be a pain.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:40.000
Gene's shot trajectory is
obstructed by obstacles.

00:04:12.133 --> 00:04:15.240
Unsurprisingly, the ball 
didn't land on the green.

00:04:20.024 --> 00:04:27.003
Thankfully, Gene still
salvaged a birdie.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Goddamnit.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.400
Third time's the charm.
Huh.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
That's the 3rd time Gene got
 a birdie with a chip-in.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.432
Goddamn...
Gene's on a roll right now.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.271
Four birdies in a row and a
goddamn eagle on his 1st hole.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.720
Landing on a heath...
not a good thing...

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.065
Too bad the birdie streak's
gonna end on this hole.

00:06:45.392 --> 00:06:47.262
Good thing the ball still 
landed on the fairway...

00:07:29.287 --> 00:07:31.288
This could be trouble...

00:07:40.288 --> 00:07:44.200
At this point, Gene's not
going to get an eagle
for this hole.

00:07:55.217 --> 00:07:58.195
But a birdie is still possible.

00:08:12.018 --> 00:08:20.800
Final Score: -8
A very good round for Gene.
